**Object Oriented Programming **
It is the programming paradigm which implements the concept of Object in the program.
An object is a collection of data and the methods which operates on that data.
It includes many principles such as inheritance,encapsulation,Polymorphism and so on.
C used procedural-oriented programming.This approch was not effective because it had some limitations such as code that could not be reused in the program.
**Class**
A Class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behaviour of objects.
It is a building block of object oriented program.
It is a user-defined data type that contains data members and member functions that operate on the data members.
