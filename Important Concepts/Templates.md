# Templates

1. Templates in C++ are amechanism that allows functions and classes to operate with generic types.

2. Allows you to write generic, reusable code without the need for repetitive code for different data types.

3. We can pass the data type as a parameter so that we don't need to write a same code for different data types.

# How templates work?

1. Templates are expanded at compile time.

2. This is like macros, difference is compiler does type_checking before template expansion.

# Function Templates

Function templates allow you to create a single function that can operate on different data types.
